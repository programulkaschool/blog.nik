Known as the golden age in African American culture, the Harlem Renaissance lasted between the 1910s and 1930s. It was a period that abounded with novels, essays, and poetry. Langton Hughes, Countee Cullen, Claude McKay, and Alain Locke were some of the most prominent authors of that time. Their works were published and reviewed in magazines and newspapers by the mainstream publishers dominated by the white. More, jazz was one of the most important elements along with the improvisation techniques which penetrated almost every discipline, such as dance and poetry. For instance, jazz poetry was more prominent, which exemplified improvisations in jazz music in the poems’ rhythmic structure.\r\n\r\nIn short, the Harlem Renaissance was the rebirth of African culture and enabled African identity to be built in a social and cultural context. Perhaps for the first time, African Americans were noted for their individual voices and their talents in various areas. To put it differently, the distinct identity and image of African society was finally manifesting itself through art, literature, music and dance in Harlem. The Lindy Hop was part of this movement.How did Lindy Hop emerge?\r\nAs a Harlem Renaissance creation, the Lindy Hop emerged in the 1920s during the Jazz Age in an Afro-American community. It’s a swing dance married to lively, dynamic and syncopated jazz music. The predecessors of the Lindy Hop are actually  quite a lot: turkey trot, the Texas mummy, ballin’ the jack, foxtrot, walkin’ the dog, the Shimmy, the Charleston and the black bottom. Though the Charleston is the major dance from which Lindy Hop is derived. Even though Lindy Hop started as a street dance, in time it got very popular, became a ballroom dance and performed at professional gigs.\r\n\r\nSavoy ballroom\r\nThe Lindy Hop gained a wider audience and recognition at the Savoy ballroom, which was founded in 1927. If you wanted to see a real performance of Lindy Hop, you had to make a visit to Savoy. It was open to everybody, both to the white and black communities, who came to Savoy to dance. In return, it allowed for racial integration during a time period when racial segregation was still very dominant.\r\n\r\nThe famous Lindy Hop dancers\r\nGeorge “Shorty” Snowden was one of the prominent figures and creators of “Lindy Hop”. Snowden was five feet tall, who turned his size into an advantage to create comic effects with his dancing. For instance,  he used to bend his knees and walk, making himself even shorter and pointing at the floor with his hands. “Shorty” came from this signature dance move. With this move, he highlighted his five-feet-tall body as a form of self-mockery. Also, Snowden had his own dancing group and appeared in films such as After Seben (1929) and Ask Uncle Sol. \r\n\r\nAnother famous group of Swing dancers formed in the Savoy was led by Herbert “Whitey” White. Known as Whitey, he had a dancing group named after him: “Whitey’s Lindy Hoppers”. Some of  the members of this group were William Downes, Frances “Mickey” Jones, Norma Miller, Billy Ricker, Al Minns, and Willa Mae Ricker. This group also trained talented dancers for competitions and professional gigs.\r\n\r\nIn the nutshell, when we think of Lindy Hop, there are two major dancing groups coming to mind. Shorty’s and Whitey’s Lindy Hoppers, which enabled Lindy Hop to gain wide public recognition.\r\n\r\nMain characteristics of Lindy Hop\r\nThe Lindy Hop involves acrobatic and aerial moves, which require certain athletic skills. Most importantly, the Lindy Hop is associated with freedom because it allows for personal expressions and improvisations. From time to time, the partners would separate and do their own solo dancing, based on their own improvisations. More, the theatrical gestures would accompany the dance movements, which reveal the soul of the dance.\r\n\r\n1980’s: The revitalization of Lindy Hop\r\nEven though Lindy Hop started as an African- American creation, since the 1980s it has started to be performed mostly by white people.  However, these performances were far from reflecting the origin of the dance. On the contrary, they altered the Lindy Hop aesthetics to a great extent. Interviews with African Americans on Lindy Hop indicate that African people feel the need to go out there and dance Lindy Hop to remind the world of its origins and its African identity.Lindy Hop’s historical and cultural aspects\r\nAs a non-discursive medium, the human body performs cultural and historical codes through dancing, especially if it is a dance like Lindy Hop, which emerged in a critical period like the African Renaissance. In the pre-history of the Harlem Renaissance, there is actually another story behind it,  starting with ring shouts, which was a religious ritual dance by African slaves.\r\n\r\nIn time, the ring shouts evolved into Cakewalk, which became one of the earliest forms  of Lindy Hop. Indeed, the cakewalk was more than a dance. It was a means of African resistance against the whites during their enslavement in America. This dance appeared as a mockery of the white men’s dancing. According to the Africans’ performance, the slaveowners would award them with cakes. That’s how the cakewalk got its name. But the main point is that the birthplace of the ring shouts and cakewalk was the plantations the African slaves used to work.\r\n\r\nGrounded on these reasons, Lindy Hop inhabits a larger historical story. As B.H. Hancock states,“As a cultural form, Lindy Hop combined slave dances with jazz and tap steps”. Also, it embeds a racial identity. However, its engagement by different communities, either intentionally or non- intentionally, leads to some deformations in the “authenticity” of the performances.Hancock’s “Embodied Ethnography and Racial Imagination”\r\n“The racial imagination, the dominant racial categories through which we understand the world, illuminates how cultural practises such as music and dance are understood only after being refracted through the racial categories that come to define them” (159)- B. H. Hancock\r\n\r\nBefore starting to talk about Hancock’s arguments, I want to state that everyone’s experience with the Lindy Hop could be quite different. Hancock’s observations as an advanced Lindy Hop dancer in different settings allowed him to see how the dance circulates racial stereotypes and myths. Given that, Hancock’s article offers some perspectives which allow us to gain an insight into how Lindy Hop is practised by the white.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hancock, cultural practises such as the Lindy Hop embody racial imagination as part of which the myth-making process occurs. To internalize what Lindy Hop is all about, Hancock learns how to dance Lindy Hop and to feel it as an embodied ethnography. Then, he starts to build more concrete theories on his observations during this stage. Afterwards, he begins teaching Lindy Hop himself in high schools with other instructors. This phase becomes very important for his research. Before explaining his on-field experiences, he mentions two practises he employs to reflect upon the white engagement of African cultural expressions. These are minstrelsy and whitewashing.\r\n\r\nMinstrelsy\r\nMinstrelsy refers to the practices of “white people intentionally performing the role of black people, drawing on historical stereotypes and mythologies of the black body as innately and essentially exotic, sexual, expressive and rhythmic.” One of the most prominent examples of this is blackface minstrel shows, which are American racist entertainments performed for white audiences. To be more explicit, white performers put on black make-up for their stage performance. For instance, Al Jolson, who was also the star of the film Jazz Singer (1927), was a well-known blackface artist.\r\n\r\nWhitewashing\r\nAs for whitewashing, whether intentional or unintentional, it refers to “the erasure or omission of the racial identity associated with the history of a particular practice or cultural form.” It can be thought of as a form of assimilation. Whitewashing occurs in two forms, according to Hancock. First, with the denial of historical origins of the dance; secondly, the inhibition of cultural expressions of the dance. For instance, the ad by the Gap company shot for the 1998 spring and summer collection, Khakis swing, misrepresented Lindy Hop. First of all, the ad only included white people on a white background. Behind the performances, you might accidently get a glimpse of people from different age groups and cultures. But in its biggest picture,the ad dehistoricizes Lindy Hop as it takes the dance away from African American origins.\r\n\r\nLindy Hop teachings and its problematics\r\nDancing requires corporeal intelligence and lots of practice to internalize the movements so that you can perform in a flow. It’s something you have to feel. To develop feelings, we might need some stories to get into the gist of the dance. Yet, sometimes these stories end up being racial myths. For instance, as Hancock states, one of the Lindy Hop instructors in a high school dance workshop introduces the dance as such: “I want all the guys to pay attention to me. Girls, you can relax for a moment. Okay, now I want the guys to do a ‘pimp walk.’ Do you guys know what a ‘pimp’ is? And do you know how a ‘pimp’ walks? I’ll show you.” In the rest of the introduction, she asks girls to stick their butt out and guys to check them out on their pretentious “pimp” walk.\r\n\r\nSome other time, Hancock attends a Lindy Hop workshop in Sweden with the best dancers ( this time as a student in an advanced class). The instructor realizes the women dance by sticking their butt out, which she finds humiliating. Everybody in the class feels shocked because, throughout their training process, it was how they were taught to dance.\r\n\r\nThese two anecdotes point out that the way a dance is taught really matters. This kind of teaching doesn’t go far from stereotyping Africans. Rather, it leads to misperceptions of African culture, which includes stigmatization and imitation of  Africans’ physical features with exaggerated movements.Lindy Hop and rethinking gender roles\r\nAs I mentioned earlier from my own experience, Lindy Hop doesn’t have any strict gender codes for partnered dancing. It just requires cooperation and attention to the other’s body. It is divorced from hypermasculine and hyperfeminine characterization of dance movements. Most importantly, both the lead’s and the follow’s dance repertoire include dynamic movements. Thus, women don’t need to perform in a fragile, hesitant and softened manner. Neither are men expected to perform masculine aggression. As Lisa Wade states in her article, “In leading, for example, they[the male dancers] are told to refrain from using brute force in favor of weight shifts and they are taught to adopt many feminized body movements, including intricate footwork, spins, body, isolation, and extras like shimmies, hip movements, and flairs with their arms” (234). Lastly, in 1939 New York World’s Fair housed all female Lindy Hop dance performance. Cultural Significance of Lindy Hop\r\nEmerging as a Harlem Renaissance creation, Lindy Hop is the epitome of social and historical lived experience. Also, it played an important role in the establishment of an African image and identity. It endowed the Lindy Hop dancers with freedom through solo parts where they show their own improvisations and self-expressions. Last but not least, Lindy Hop appears at the end of a long journey, starting with ring shouts, cakewalks. Thus, it embeds history and culture in its veins.\r\n\r\nAbove all, Lindy Hop allows us to rethink racial factors that affect our cultural engagements consciously or unconsciously. As we see in the example of Hancock, the ethnographic approach highlights the importance of active participation. It also enables the researcher to see the biggest picture as much as possible. Proving itself as topography for ethnographic investigations, Lindy Hop allows us to reimagine race and gender.', 1, '2021-08-17 18:25:54', 0),

Consisting of different ethnic groups, the Aztecs dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 14th to the 16th centuries. Different ethnic groups mean there’ll be different traditions and beliefs arising within them. This blog explores the Aztec religion and mythology.The Aztecs believed in a polytheistic religion. Some of the gods that the Aztecs believed in had been in their religion since its birth, while others were adopted into their culture when they conquered different lands.\r\n\r\nThe Aztecs believed in a religion that prompted them to constantly try and win blessings from the gods. Offerings and sacrifices, which could be human or otherwise, were regularly made to win the gods’ favours.The heavens and underworld\r\nThe Aztecs believed in the heavens and the underworld. According to the Aztec religion, there are thirteen levels of heaven, while there are nine levels in the underworld. There are also four horizontal and vertical points that correspond to the four directions of the compass. These four directions are associated with the four gods of creation. Depending on the day they are born, all human beings are assigned to one of the four points.Ometecutli and Omeciuatl, the Lord and Lady of Duality. Credit@ Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature\r\nAccording to the Aztecs, the earth was a huge disc that was surrounded by water at the central point where the horizontal and vertical met. This central point was believed to be ruled by the above-mentioned Lord and Lady of Duality, Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl.Death and afterlife\r\nAccording to the Aztecs, it is one’s actions and the manner of death on earth that’ll decide where one will go after one dies.\r\n\r\nThe eastern paradise or the house of the sun is where the souls of the warriors who died in combat go. This paradise also serves as the home for the souls of the enemy warriors who had a special god of the enemy dead. The souls of the victims who served as sacrifices during offerings or rituals also went to the house of the sun. However, it is believed that the souls did not stay permanently in the eastern paradise. After lasting for four years there, they return to the earth, reincarnated as hummingbirds and other exotic birds.\r\n\r\nThe western paradise or the house of corn was for the women who lost their lives in childbirth. They would then return to the earth as phantoms bearing bad omens.\r\n\r\nThe southern paradise or the paradise of Tlaloc was for the people who died of leprosy, lightening or other sicknesses. This paradise is a place with plenty of food.\r\n\r\nThe paradise of the north, called Mictlan, was the final resting place of the dead. To get there, it involved passing through nine trials, which took at least four years to accomplish.\r\n\r\nReaching Mictlan\r\nAccording to the Aztecs, a soul must go through a number of trials before it can get to Mictlan. They are as follows-\r\n\r\nCross a deep river where dogs were buried along with their dead owners, so they have a guide during this journey\r\nPass between two mountains that were actually joined together\r\nClimb atop an obsidian mountain\r\nPass through ice-cold wind that cuts like a knife\r\nPass through an area where flags waved\r\nGet pierced by arrows\r\nPass through wild beasts which have devoured human hearts\r\nWalk over a narrow stone path\r\nReach this level where the soul can rest in peaceTo make this trip, deceased people were buried in a squatting position. Buried along with them are a number of items that help them on their journey. These include the dog which is mentioned above and will help guide the person, water, a jade bead which acts as the dead person’s heart in the seventh level and many other personal objects to gift to Mictlantecuhtli (god of the dead) or Mictecacihuatl, who is the mistress of the underworld when they enter the ninth level.', 1, '2021-08-17 18:30:06', 2),
(3, 'img-post.jpg', 'Ancient Detoxification Methods To Lead A Healthy Life', 'Going by the dictionary meaning, ‘detoxing’ or ‘detoxification’ eliminates harmful and poisonous elements. In healthcare and also partially in lifestyle, detoxing is the removal of toxic substances from the body. It is a medicinal and scientific way to rejuvenate and recharge the human body through diets and other simple steps.\r\n\r\nDetoxification is a natural and ongoing process in the human body that helps a person maintain optimal health. Additionally, it constantly filtrates the body’s organs – liver, colon, kidneys, lungs, lymphatic system, and skin, to remove the unwanted toxins.Detoxofication as an Effective Method\r\nMedical experts believe that natural and automatic detoxification is all the human body needs. But, as we expose ourselves to toxicity around us from different sources, the body also requires external detoxification to boost the functioning of the organs. The intrusion of toxins or other harmful substances into the human body can be from internal and external sources. In modern times, the exposure of toxicity is proportionately increasing. The rapidly increasing pollution rate in all spheres exposes humans to more and more synthetic chemicals, hard metals, and other harmful compounds. Additionally, fried and junk foods, added salt, refined sugars, trans fats, food additives, pesticides, synthetic skincare products, caffeine, cigarettes, and alcohol all lead to toxins in the body – for which the normal detoxing process gets overloaded.\r\n\r\nDetoxification is a process that needs regular practice. However, some symptoms indicate higher levels of toxins in the body and need a boost to detoxify.\r\n\r\nFatigue\r\nGastrointestinal problems\r\nSkin irritation and allergies\r\nAcidity and bloating\r\nPuffy eyes\r\nMood swings, irritation, and anxiety\r\nDetox Diet Foods\r\nDetoxing implies following a specific diet plan or following certain things to eliminate toxins from the body. The process of detoxification can vary from person to person and also in terms of activities.   A detox diet should be rich in herbal and healthy foods. In addition, the diet should contain vitamins, sulfur, amino acids, selenium, lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and prebiotics.\r\n\r\nFoods containing Vitamins and Antioxidants\r\nThe human body produces a molecule called free radicals to function in the body’s cellular processes, including digestion and others. These free radicals in the body cause the breakdown of the cells and create oxidative stress. Additionally, they are also responsible for ageing. With time, the human body loses its ability to fight these free radicals, leading to more of them and causing damage to cells in the body. Also, alcohol, tobacco smoke, a poor diet, and exposure to pollutants. It is because the external sources produce excessive free radicals and oxidative stress. Thus, eating a diet containing antioxidants can help the body fight oxidative stress caused by excessive free radicals and toxins. The foods rich in antioxidants include berries, fruits, nuts, beetroot, cocoa, vegetables, spices, lemon, brown rice, watercress, coffee, and green tea.Foods containing sulfur, amino acids, and prebiotics\r\nWith more pollution from cars and other machinery, chemicals in water, food colouring, and preservatives in our daily consumed foods, our body needs to detoxify at a cellular level. During the process, the liver uses a molecular structure called a methyl group to do very specialized detoxification processes of Vitamin B12. The primary detoxification that the liver does comes from a sulfur-rich structure called glutathione. It is a mixture of a sulfur molecule and the Amino Acid Methionine. Likewise, prebiotics are an essential type of fibre that feeds the good bacteria in the human body. With prebiotics, good bacteria can produce nutrients called short-chain fatty acids that are beneficial for health.  The diet rich in sulfur and other components includes protein-containing whole foods, onions, garlic, eggs, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, and Brussels sprouts.\r\n\r\nThings to Do\r\nApart from the diet, some other activities and practices help improve the detoxification process.\r\n\r\nA regular sleep schedule is always healthy practice for good health. Sleeping is considered a recharge process for the brain to function properly to remove toxins from the body. Therefore, sleep deprivation or a poor sleep schedule affects both short and long-term health issues.\r\nThe human body needs water intake to support the process of rebuilding and repairing cells and performing detoxification. The optimum water intake for men is 3.7 litres and 2.7 litres for women.\r\nFasting for 1-3 days or limiting some aspects of the diet is a healthy practice to rest the body’s organs. In addition, limiting sugar and salt intake in the diet contributes to detoxing the unwanted elements.\r\nDecreasing the consumption of alcohol and other harmful substances helps hugely in the process of detoxification. In addition, less consumption of alcohol means it limits the excessive production of free radicals.\r\nA healthy skincare routine helps to remove toxins from the body. The skin is considered the third kidney of the body and the largest organ. In addition, nourishing the skin stimulates the turnover of new cells and encourages the flow of lymph fluid, another detoxification pathway.\r\nA regular exercise schedule eliminates the threat of toxins in the body. In addition, a daily round of moderate and high-intensity burnout of calories can push many diseases miles away.\r\nThe detoxification process is cleansing the body, just like cleaning our houses at intervals or becoming dirty. Additionally, the process helps us to eliminate harmful elements from the body. It is medicinal and scientific yet does not need external medical supervision for a simple and basic level of detoxification.Ancient Detox Methods\r\nMany efficient ancient procedures still exist and are excellent ways to eliminate toxic chemicals from the body.\r\n\r\nNative American Cleansing\r\nThe Native American tribes use purification ceremonies to purify the mind, cure the body, and invoke visions. The sweat lodge, which promotes profound healing, was the primary source of cleansing. Some tribes drink tea before and after the sweat lodge detox to boost the amount of detoxification. In certain Native American cultures, detoxification includes smudging, which cleans the air using sacred plants. Cedar, juniper, and resins are some of the herbs that they use.\r\n\r\nShamanism Cleansing\r\nSeveral native rainforest tribes have cleansing traditions that focus on limpias, herbal dietas, and plant medicine rites. Limpias are spiritual and emotional cleanses that use herb smoke to clear the air and cleanse the body with fresh herbs and flowers. The flowers and herbs selected are determined by the disease. For example, white sage alleviates anger and conflict.\r\n\r\nPlant medicine rituals link to the use of berries, flowers, and fresh plants. Ancient people relied entirely on nature to meet their needs. A medicine man, also known as a shaman, conducts the ritual using self-produced herbs. Certain “power” plants that the Shamanistic culture uses are poisonous, and only an expert should handle them.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Rainforest’ tea \r\n\r\nIngredients \r\n\r\n1/2 tsp lemon juice\r\n 1 tsp freshly grated/powdered turmeric\r\n 3 tsp Chanca Piedra powder\r\n ¼ tsp Boldo leaf powder\r\n 2 tsp Moringa powder\r\n 1 tsp Powdered nettles\r\n 1 tsp Pau D’ Arco\r\nPreparation Process \r\n\r\nMix all the herbs in one-litre water and let it infuse for some time.\r\nMix it well, so the ingredients activate.\r\nDrink the mix on an empty stomach in the morning\r\nRussian Detox Method\r\nThe Russian method of cleansing and detoxifying the liver is through the use of raisins. Although there have been no formal studies on the efficacy of this technique, the Russians rely on this method devotedly. The essential item to look for in this method is raisins not treated with sulphur dioxide. You can get raisins at any market. However, make sure to check that it doesn’t contain sulphur dioxide. If you fail to find natural raisins, you can create your own by drying organic red grapes in a food dehydrator.\r\n\r\nPreparation Method \r\n\r\nSoak 1/2 cup of raisins in hot water for 15 minutes.\r\nRinse them well with cool water.\r\nBoil water again and let it cool down until room temperature.\r\nStore the raisins in a jar and pour boiled water into them. Let it stand for 24 hours.\r\nEat the raisins and drink the water in the morning on an empty stomach.\r\nLie down for 1-2 hours with a bottle of warm water placed on the right side of your abdomen.\r\nOn detox days, avoid consuming any oils, dairy, meat, or spicy meals. It is essential to set aside one day a week for cleansing.\r\nAncient Indian Detox Methods\r\nSmudging is an integral part of the Indian detoxification process to cleanse the body. For example, smoke made from white sage, juniper, cedar, and resins, cleanses the body, removes negativity and excess toxins, and purifies the surrounding air.\r\n\r\nAyurveda Cleansing\r\nAyurveda is a holistic healing method that originated in India. Toxins erase from your body through two primary techniques in this system: panache karma and palliation. Panache karma includes physical procedures like medicinal enemas and purgatives, whereas palliation uses pungent herbs to induce a hot digestive activity that burns away impurities. Other heat treatments, such as sunbathing, are used to induce the release of toxins. Enemas and heat have long been in use to remove toxins. However, always exercise caution if you have any stomach issues before using these detox treatments.Ayurveda Detox\r\nAyurveda is one of the best and oldest detoxification systems in the world. It relies on the belief that good health depends on a delicate balance between mind, body and spirit.\r\n\r\nAyurvedic Detox Tea \r\n\r\ngreen tea\r\nseeds of fennel\r\ncoriander seeds\r\nseeds of seeds\r\nfresh sliced ginger\r\nlemon juice\r\nturmeric root.\r\nYou can mix spices like cinnamon, cloves or cardamom. Drink tea throughout the day. It helps to remove body toxins and also restores metabolism.\r\n\r\nActivated Carbon\r\nActivated carbon is a kind of carbon with a large surface area and has a high negative charge. It has been in use for thousands of years. In modern times, activated carbon is used in emergency rooms to treat poisoning. Charcoal eliminates pollutants, heavy metals, and toxins from the stomach and digestive system. However, it is also capable of removing beneficial components like vitamins and minerals. As such, it is recommended not to take it within an hour of taking other supplements.\r\n\r\nThings to Note While Detoxing\r\nToxin buildup in our body harms both our physical and mental wellbeing. Detoxification of the entire body will help to balance it from time to time. Holistic treatment always favours the body as a whole beyond a single symptom or disease. Toxin buildup is not something that should be handled individually or in isolation. It is a symptom of a more significant problem with the body as a whole and the body as a whole needs restoration to health. However, there are a few things that you should keep in mind while adopting a detoxification method.\r\n\r\nAvoid dairy, meat, oils, and spicy meals on detox days since they disrupt the process. To keep up with primary bodily care, setting aside one day a week for cleaning is essential.\r\nYou may combine other items with basic detox procedures such as teas. To boost the effect of the herbs, try sweat lodges, steam treatment, or sauna heat therapy. Experiment with varied detoxification therapies and techniques to figure out what is best for you.\r\nIf you adopt an aggressive detox, consider using enema treatments to assist your body. However, be sure that the enemas procedure is safe and sanitary. If you have any digestive health issues, consult your doctor before having an enema.\r\nDetoxification\r\nDrink plenty of water. Being hydrated assists your body in naturally removing toxins. It also enhances the degree of your detox. To get into the habit of drinking more water, substitute water for your other regular beverages, like soda.\r\nPractise breathing techniques to help you breathe more deeply. As the body’s circulation improves when it gets more oxygen, deep breathing will help a lot. Spend a few minutes each day practising deep breathing.\r\nHydrotherapy can be beneficial too. Take a five-minute hot shower, allowing the water to flow down your back. After that, rinse with cold water for around 30 seconds. After you’ve done this three times in a row, lie down for around 30 minutes.\r\nConsume many whole foods. The lesser chemicals you feed the body, the fewer toxins you will acquire. Cleansing is more effective when there are fewer toxic chemicals in the body, and you will feel better too.\r\nConclusion\r\nToday, we see and understand that we don’t seek the best in health or modern medicine through detoxification. It is actually the coordinated mind and body fine-tuning with the environment. Ancient detox procedures are still in use today because of their benefits to those who employ them.\r\n\r\nExamine these ancient techniques to see which ones are best for your health and lifestyle. Try traditional detoxification techniques to help you get your body and mind in better shape. Also, eliminate junk food, chemicals, and fried fast food from your diet and live a healthy lifestyle. Happy Detoxing!\r\n\r\n', 1, '2021-08-17 18:31:53', 2),
(4, 'img-post.jpg', 'Asian Household Rules: A History Behind These Interesting Traditions', 'People often get confused by so many household rules when they visit their Asian friends, especially those friends who originated from Southeast Asia. One of the most famous things about Asian people is how strict they are to their family members – also to anyone that enters their houses. Some Asians will feel offended if visitors don’t obey certain rules in their culture, although it’s not always the case.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of traditional Asian household rules and they are all unique and interesting. Some of the rules come from historical reasons, and some of the rules come from ancient mythologies. This blog aims to provide you with an entry-level understanding of different Asian customs and why they are derived from Southeast Asian history.It is probably the most common rule when you visit Asian houses or hang out with your Asian friends. Same as in Asian restaurants, they will never run out of hot water supply. However, in general, hot water doesn’t seem to be a very popular option for Westerners when it comes to drinks.\r\n\r\nCustom of Health and Hygiene\r\nBack in the 4th century, the Ancient Chinese people discovered the medical use of hot water: to expel humidity from the human body and promote blood circulation. Cold water supposedly has the opposite effect, slowing organ function and causing painful muscle contractions. Thus, hot water is often touted as the cure for everything from sore throats to stiffness to cramps to fatigue. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), humidity is an important concept. TCM believes that humidity causes a lot of diseases such as chronic arthritis, fatigue, appetite loss and indigestion. Thus, drinking hot water can help get rid of the bad influences of humidity.\r\n\r\nAlthough the idea has been around since 200 BC, it wasn’t so popular until 1862. Mainly because having a stove and enough fuel to make boiling water was a luxury in ancient times, hot water was only available to nobles and people who were in need. Around 1862, a cholera epidemic broke out in Qing China. The Qing government soon realized that the southerners were less sick than northerners because people living in South China drank more hot water. There indeed are some scientific reasons, because some bacteria and viruses can’t live in extreme temperatures. After the foundation of PRC, the CCP government promoted hot water during a national health campaign in 1952.\r\n\r\nHot water was widespread in Southeast Asia because of the huge influence of TCM. Also, the Chinese emigration from Fujian and Guangdong provinces contributed a lot in promoting hot water.\r\n\r\nSame as drinking hot water, Asian people take off their shoes before entering their houses for hygiene reasons. Simply because the shoes you wear outside may bring back dirty things. But, barefoot is also a no-no in an Asian household. There is another interesting story behind this Asian custom.\r\n\r\nAgain, in TCM, it is unhealthy to be barefoot indoors or outdoors. There’s a saying in Chinese: “Every disease comes from coldness, and coldness comes from your feet.” The concept explains that if your hands and feet get cold, you will have bad peripheral blood circulation, which is not good. Because the peripheral vascular system is fairly far from the heart. The veins beneath our arms and legs don’t carry much heat and are easy to lose temperature. One solution to keep our bodies warm is to cover them up. So that people should always wear something to cover their feet since their feet directly touch the ground.\r\n\r\nCustom of Courtesy\r\nDespite the medical and hygiene reasons above, there are also religious and courtesy reasons too. From Vietnam to China, it’s a sign of disrespect to enter a temple with shoes. Plus, in some Hindu temples in India, oil is often used during prayers, so you might even slip and fall if you’re not careful. Indoor slippers and socks are provided in most Asian countries. In Japan and South Korea, they even have heated floors to help your feet keep warm.\r\n\r\nI have heard of another story, though it is a myth. In ancient times, when people came back home at night, they must leave shoes outside of their house to prevent bad luck from entering their houses. Because you might have stepped on “things” you would never want to deal with. Leave your shoes outside so “things” can’t get in.A table of Asian food with traditional Asian cutleries. Credit to Heart of the City.\r\nSoutheast Asia has lots of delicious food. Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese…you name it and we have it. However, it is not easy to keep up with the strict Asian household rules on the dining table. Let’s have a look at the most common customs.\r\n\r\nHow to Use Your Chopsticks\r\nHow to hold your chopsticks is no longer an issue, as long as you can pick up food without dropping them, you are fine. The problem is how to use chopsticks correctly with courtesy. Chinese chopsticks are just two thin wooden or metal sticks with an even thickness. But the Japanese chopsticks are more pointy at the front. Korean ones are not long columns but are flat. This is because of the diversity of diets and table manners in different countries. In China, people didn’t think a lot when inventing chopsticks. They are for picking food from cooking pots, that’s it. But when chopsticks entered Japan and Korea, people started to make adaptions. The pointy ends of Japanese chopsticks allow people to stab fish meat and sushi. (No stabbing your food in Chinese culture. )The flat chopsticks in Korea is to stop them from sliding off the table.\r\n\r\nGenerally, you cannot stab chopsticks into your rice and make them “stand” in the bowl. In traditional Asian customs, a bowl of rice with chopsticks “standing” is for people who have passed away. It could bring you bad luck if you do so. Also, don’t hit your plates and bowls with chopsticks as if you are playing the drums. Only beggars do that to attract your attention to get some food or money.\r\n\r\nHow to Hold Your Bowl\r\nIt is even more diverse when talking about the Asian household rules on how to hold the bowls. I have heard so many different ways of “being impolite” when holding the bowl on the dining table. According to my mom (we are from Southeast China), only beggars will use their left hand only to hold the bowl off the table and eat. But some of my Asian friends think it is totally fine to lift the bowl to your mouth level and use chopsticks to push rice into your mouth. You can also leave the bowl on the table and eat from it – but don’t drop anything on the table, it is impolite!\r\n\r\nEat Quietly But You Can Slurp\r\nYou cannot talk when there’s still food in your mouth, as this is disrespectful. Also, don’t chew with your mouth open. But it is okay to drink soup directly from the bowl and make one slurp or two. In Japan, slurping when drinking soup is showing respect to chefs, as if saying the food was good. However, that doesn’t mean rules go out the window. If you’re dining with a large group, remember to care for others’ feelings.\r\n\r\nAsians appear to have large families in general due to historical reasons. There are many branches in the family tree. Unlike Westerners, Asians cannot just call out the names of their family members. There are lots and lots of different titles for each one of your relatives from your dad’s side and your mom’s side. When you are married, the tree grows even bigger and more titles are adding to the tree because now you have to include your partner’s family tree as well – and how you call your partner’s relatives are again completely different from how your partner call them!\r\n\r\nThere aren’t even enough English words to describe each title. But basically, the different titles are originated in Ancient China when patriarchy started to be more favourable to society. In Chinese, things become a lot more nuanced. In addition to keeping track of generation and gender, other factors such as maternal vs. paternal lineage, relative age, and married vs. blood all need to be considered. All children are considered as the hire of their father, not their mother, and males are included more than females. Therefore, relative titles from your mom’s side have a meaning of “outsider” because your mom “joined” your dad’s family. This is actually a bad part of Asian culture because the family tree promotes patriarchy and devalues women. Your mom, under this structure, doesn’t belong to any side of the family tree after she married your dad. I would say it is very toxic.\r\n\r\nLearning the Social Hierarchy\r\nAlthough lots of young Asians are starting to realise that patriarchy is wrong and toxic, a fairly long history has already affected every aspect of Asian household rules, even social rules. It is indeed correct to respect seniors in society, but some countries promote it too much and it causes lots of unfairness. For example, in Japan and South Korea, it is very important that you should be extremely humble to people older than you, no matter if they are truly worth respecting or not. In their language system, they developed Honorifics to show extra politeness and respect to elderly people and bosses. Honorifics are probably the hardest part when people try to learn Japanese and Korean.\r\n\r\nSouth Korea has the most strict hierarchy system across all Southeast Asian countries. It is everywhere – normally, the hierarchy system would exist in the workplace, such as in Japan and China. But in South Korea, it exists everywhere – school, workplace, your neighborhood, your family…Also, it matters so much to them. If you are older than your boss, your boss would feel uncomfortable. The social hierarchy also causes relative deprivation, which leads to high suicide and depression rates in China, Japan and South Korea.\r\n\r\nAsian Household Rule #5: Show Some Respect\r\nAs mentioned above, it is very important for Asians to be respectful to others and be humble. This is because the traditional custom requires people to behave and have good manners in order to promote social stability back to ancient times.Mind Your Head and Hands\r\nIn many Asian cultures, the head is considered the most sacred part of the body. You should never touch anyone on the head – even children or Buddha statues. On the other end, the feet are considered the dirtiest part of the body as they touch the ground and are furthest from the head. You should never point the soles of your feet at anyone or anything sacred… It will look like you’re giving them the finger! If you’re sitting down in a temple, restaurant or home, remember to keep your feet politely tucked beneath you.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nAll Asian household rules have a historical reason behind them. Although all of the reasons are out of good wills, not all of the rules lead to good outcomes. Some customs such as drink preference should stay the same way as they are truly beneficial to society, but some of them, such as the strict hierarchy, should be reconsidered for the general well-being. As the world keeps developing, these not-so-good traditions should evolve as well to adapt.', 5, '2021-08-17 18:34:18', 64);

(5, 'img-post.jpg', 'Food Linguistics: Evolution of Food, Menus, and Online Reviews', 'Linguistic and cultural anthropology can reveal a lot about languages and culture through mediums such as food menus, online reviews, and advertisements. According to Barbara Miller (2005), linguistics is the study of language. Questions that anthropologists ask and research revolve around how a person’s language relates to one’s culture, and how and why they change over time. How do online interactions affect language and communication? Over time, food cultures have transformed drastically, and how food has been described linguistically and procured can be traced through many years.\r\n\r\nFor this blog post, I will share my information from The Language of Food, Stanford University Linguist by Dan Jurafsky. The author provides a rich history and evolution of food as well as a captivating analysis of the sharing of cultures and traditions through food. During their research, he and his colleagues made use of computational linguistic tools, online menus and reviews, food advertisements, and brands in order to find how languages and cultures are cognitively shared and passed on.\r\n\r\nFirst, the author begins by exploring how tomato ketchup made its way from Asia to the United States and how foods reveal patterns of global exploration, and then he expands into how to read and decode a menu and online reviews linguistically through sound and olfactory senses. Jurafsky “offers a window” into the past through the history of food and presents modern linguistical phenomena in order to show how language reveals so much about food, people, and a culture itself.Food History: Ketchup\r\nJurafsky traces the origination of ketchup and wine and toasting, and even the order of meals to allow the reader to uncover the reasons behind global influences and culinary connection through language.\r\n\r\nDid you know that ketchup is actually Chinese and the word originally meant fish sauce?  Sweet-tomato ketchup actually originated from Asia as a fermented fish sauce and made its way to the United States and Europe. It comes from the Hokkien Chinese word, ke-tsiap, and is originally a sauce from fish that is fermented. In the 1690s, the British had a trading post in Bengkulu and they took the recipe back to the United Kingdom in order to try to replicate it. One of the earliest recipes, in 1732 is from the Indies.\r\n\r\nJurafsky believes that around this time, the word “ketchup” first came into the English language partially due to the fact that the English could not pronounce the Asian word, ke-tisap. Ketchup had become profitable and in several reports from traders from the East India Trading Company including Charles Lockyer, the dialogues in the reports revealed how important it was to be trading with Asia.  Lockyer said, “soy comes in tubs from Jappan, and the best Ketchup from Tonqueen (northern Vietnam) yet good of both sorts, are made and solvery cheap in China.. I know not a more profitable commodity.”History: Drinking and Toasting around Food\r\nJurafsky explains how drinking cultures, including the act of toasting, became deeply embedded in cultures going as far back as 6000 BCE through libations and domestication of wine grapes. Domesticated wine grapes have been found to exist as early as 6000 BCE found in a Neolithic village called Hajji Firuz Tepe in the Zagros Mountains in Iran (71). While evidence appears to be unclear to how alcohol evolved, several types of wine and beer may have been associated with health and thought to have some antipathogenic properties. One early concept related to toasting is called a libation, an offering of mead, wine, or oil, that the Greek people poured to the gods before drinking. Overall, drinking and toasting have always played an important role in celebrations.\r\n\r\nWith these forgotten histories of ketchup, alcohol, and even ceviche (which is mentioned more in his book) that the author offers, the reader can value and recognize the hardships and labor that went into the procurement of food that appears as always available for society today. Throughout his historical and evolutionary analysis, he successfully finds how people were brought together and connected through food and how language evolved through the discussion and written reports on these different foods.Understanding and Decoding Menus \r\nThe words in menus have linguistic, hidden clues about the origination of the food being prepared, the cost and the price of the restaurant, and also the types of chefs that run the restaurant. According to Jurafsky, expensive restaurants are very likely to display where each of their dishes originates by using words such as “grass-fed” and even over advertise their products. These types of places show pride in their work and accomplishments and even love to place prominence over their chef.\r\n\r\nCostly food establishments have an inclination to make use of more two-bit multisyllabic unique, fancy words such as “accompaniments, complements, traditionally, specifications, preparation, magnificent, tenderness,” while cheaper ones tend to use positive words shorter in length as “tasty,” “delicious,” “decaf,” and “sides” (13). Even the addition of one letter hints at a correlation with an increase of 18 cents (14).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, menus that contain long words may be more aimed at tourists or non-native eaters who do not eat the food being served every day and may be unaware of the actual food prices allowing the restaurants to secretively upcharge. If a restaurant emphasizes the types of “spices” or exoticness of a food, the price may be raised (14).  Jurafsky concludes that restaurant menus that consist of lengthy and descriptive words for each dish have a tendency for being expensive establishments overall.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a third idea presented by Jurafsky for understanding menu prices can be termed as  “linguistic fillers,” which are characterized as vague words like “delicious, tasty, mouth-watering, flavorful, scrumptious, tasty, wonderful and delightful,” and “appealing adjectives” such as “zesty, rich, golden brown, crunchy.” (15). Compared to expensive restaurants, cheaper restaurants use positive words, but also tend to use more vague words. Words such as “delicious and tasty” are used and are open for interpretation. Cheaper restaurants are likely to say that food should be served “your way” so it attracts more customers. The linguistic fillers and appealing adjectives are associated with cheaper restaurants because they serve as a tease for the guests; a promise for distinct or exceptional food that actually may not exist.\r\n\r\nThe author’s analysis of cost and word lengths depicts the true causation between expensive restaurants and lengthy words and cheap restaurants and shorter words.  The restaurants and chefs that want to be deemed as prestigious and appear to show pride in their work make use of different adjectives and verbs than the cheaper establishments that exist. The length and type of words can reveal so much about the culture of a restaurant including the types of people, social norms, and the type of establishment. However, Jurafsky’s analysis presented could be deemed as flawed in 2020, because he should have included several examples of data sets, graphs, statistics, actual numbers associated with restaurants.\r\n\r\nFood reviews \r\nSource: http://www.allstarsteamer.com/star-steamer-llc/yelp/\r\nPreview(opens in a new tab)\r\n\r\nDecoding Business Reviews  \r\nOnline reviews play a large role in helping people decide where to eat and purchase food, as well as reveal human psychological behavior, perception, and thought.  In a few studies, Jurafsky and colleagues make use of computational linguistics to examine the type of positive and negative Yelp reviews from restaurants in cities such as San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Boston, LA, Philadelphia, and Washington, which reveal people’s thoughts and feelings about restaurants from 2005 to 2011.\r\n\r\nWhile good or positive reviews include positive sentimental words such as “love, delicious, best, amazing, favorite, perfect, excellent, awesome,”  bad reviews use negative emotional words including “horrible, bad, worst, terrible, awful, disgusting, bland, gross, mediocre, tasteless, sucks, nasty, inedible, yuck and stale” (94).\r\n\r\nReviews also contain lots of expressive words and exaggerations. Jurafsky exhibits his term “semantic bleaching” as a way to describe human exaggeration or as an “awe,” responsible for changing meaning in words such as “sauce or salsa” from their original meaning of “salted.”\r\n\r\nIn positive reviews, people who have a good time at a restaurant are shown to be more likely to use sexual metaphors and also have a positive correlation with a higher price of the restaurant. It has been shown that the more reviews mention dessert, the more they have the tendency to like the restaurant (104). Good reviews are also associated with positive emotional words or positive words. Words such as “love, delicious, best, amazing, great, favorite, perfect, excellent, awesome, wonderful, fantastic, and incredible” are all examples of positive words used in food reviews (94).\r\n\r\nFor bad reviews, Jurafsky terms “negative differentiation” as a way to describe bad opinions rather than positive ones,  and these occur across many languages and many kinds of work.  Words like horrible and terror are used to mean “inducing horror” or “inducing terror” (94). In anthropology and psychology, most theorists have revealed that humans are biased and maybe more aware of negative situations. Negative reviews are shown to have the pronouns of “us” and “we” when describing distasteful traumas. Reviews that contain some experiences, such as waiting for food too long or not being served well, always start with the words “us and we” at different locations. In their analysis, they found that beers that were deemed as “bad” were written as “watery, bland, corny, skunky, metallic, stale, chemical, piss, yellow, disgusting, colorless, skanky, thin, flat, fizzy, and over-carbonated (96).\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, positive reviews of food establishments that served beer were deemed as “amazing, wonderful, fantastic, awesome, incredible, and great” regardless of the taste, feel, look or smell. It may be that negative reviews are actually more descriptive, and more time and care is taken into choosing words when leaving a bad review.\r\n\r\nResponse to Food Reviews by business owners\r\n\r\nMost interestingly, people actually respond more to positive reviews than negative ones (104). Oftentimes, restaurants try to deal with negative reviews by responding to the issue on the same review board, reconciling the issue, and/or providing a solution as soon as possible so the review doesn’t hurt their business. They want to make sure they emphasize with the customer and apologize for their actions so that the customer feels heard and also saves their business image.\r\n\r\nHumans have the tendency to remember positive reviews rather than negative views. However, if people have been traumatized by a certain event, they will remember the negative parts and may even post several reviews on different sites. Simply put, more research needs to be done to reveal why we simply remember the bad events more than the good ones, and why others remember the good events instead of the bad events? The linguistic analysis Jurafsky describes through the differences in positive and negative reviews serves as a framework for understanding linguistics, human nature, emotions, and opinions.Smell Vocabularies in Menus\r\nSome languages have many, olfactory vocabularies including Cantonese and Mandarin, and these languages are rich in negative smells. Yik, the smell of rancid or oxidized oil or peanuts, Seng meaning fishy, blood smell, Jurafsky’s team analyzed several online reviewers and their discussion of beers they disliked at sou, meaning musky, muttony, gamy, body and order smell (97). While these negative vocabulary words are actually not being used as much in Cantonese, smell words still hold meaning. The vast majority of many different types of smell have made it difficult to maintain a “shared stable vocabulary of smell words” and people interpret each smell word uniquely (98).\r\n\r\nSound Vocabularies in Food\r\nLastly, Jurfaksy shows that there are similar consonants and vowel sounds that help us to make meaning out of food words. The sound of a food word can tell us a lot about a particular item of food or menu item through his idea of sound symbolism. Sound symbolism has been studied with vowels, particularly front vowels and back vowels (161). According to Jurafsky, sound symbolism plays an important role in modern advertising and designer names and some companies even get their ideas from linguists (164).\r\n\r\nIt is said that mammals and birds use low-frequency sounds when they are angry or upset and use high-frequency sounds when they are happy. On the contrary, humans have the tendency to associate different pitches and frequencies of sounds with sizes. “Chips, Cheese, Wheat Thins, Pretzel Things, Ritz, Krispy, Triscuits, Cheese Crips all have front vowel words” and back vowel names in ice cream names like Rock Roady, Almond, Fudge, Chocolate, Caramel, Cooking Dough and Coconut (164). These words sound so appetizing when they are being spoken that they can almost see and hear the foods. The frequency sounds reveal that consonants and vowels have helped to create a rich system of meaning in our languages.Significance in Anthropology\r\nThe various links between unique food words and the way that they are used, read and heard can show how dishes are procured and the processes that occur to produce them. Menus can tell the customers a lot about the cost of the establishment and the type of place it is just by reading the words. Through the historical tracing of ketchup and drinking culture and the analysis of online reviews and menus, the reader is offered a lens into how certain words produce certain emotions and reactions. The next time you see a menu, maybe you will see each food word in a new light.', 6, '2021-08-17 18:36:16', 0),
(6, 'img-post.jpg', 'Narrow Escapes from the Berlin Wall to Find Liberty', 'The Berlin Wall was a barbed barrier to the flow of refugees to find liberty after World War 2. The Communist Government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) was worried about the seemingly endless flow of refugees. Nearly 3 million young skilled workers, such as engineers, teachers, doctors, and nurses, had found a way to leave the GDR since the end of the blockage. Only in June 1961, around 19,000 people went to the west through Berlin. In July, 30,000 East Germans crossed the border, and in August 16,000 fled. The culmination point was that 2,400 defectors crossed the border in a single day.\r\n\r\nPrior to the construction of the wall, residents on both sides of Berlin moved around freely enough. They traversed the border to visit, to work, to shop, to enjoy pieces of plays or the movies. Trains and subway lines ran back and forth. But, every kind of transportation or communication was locked down after the building of the wall and barbed barrier, except three checkpoints: Helmstedt, Dreilinden, and the center of Berlin. Diplomats and officials of the allied nations could enter or leave if they met the strict requirements of the German East.\r\n\r\nOn August 13, 1961, East Germany decided to construct barbed wire and concrete to cease mass defections from East to West. The Berlin Wall served as an ugly symbol of ideological division by snaking through the city. It was almost 27 miles long and built with a barbed barrier, under the control of attack dogs, and with a threat of 55,000 landmines. Though the barrier almost lasted between 1961 and 1989, it could not retain a massive democratic movement. The huge escape of defectors showed the not-too-distant fall of the social German Democratic Republic.\r\n\r\nNarrow escapes from the Berlin Wall\r\nRight after building the border between the Federal Republic of Germany and the GDR, the East Germans found the ruling government full of inhumanity and looked for a life of liberty. Although facing lots of threats, dangers, and death, Berliners tried any means to realize their willingness or dream to seek liberty at any cost. Some were lucky to have death-dealing narrow escapes from the current government to go to a country of liberty, while others lost their lives in a communist country.Conrad Schumann was born in 1942 into a middle-class family that lived in farming. From childhood, his father trained him as a sheepherder to help the family to oversee a herd of 50 sheep. At the age of 19, he joined the army and was assigned as a border policeman. On the afternoon of August 15, 1961, as a head constable, he took a regular patrol right on the barbed barrier at Bernauer Straße. When the government decided to seal off the border on August 13, 1961, his unit was stationed on the sector boundary.When the Berlin Wall began to be erected the day before, a low barbed barrier was put to mark the border. After a few days, Schumann took a patrol at the corner of Bernauer Strasse and Ruppiner Strasse and saw it was an opportunity for him to carry out his dream of changing life. At that moment, he felt restless, walked back and forth nervously, and ceaselessly smoked. Then, he took a glance around him to find if a border guard was watching him. He hesitated for a moment and decided to leap over the barbed barrier. Luckily, there was a group of journalists who were writing coverage of what had happened at the other side of the Berlin Wall. Suddenly, they saw a young man in an army uniform jump over the barbed barrier.\r\n\r\nLeap into liberty\r\nIn fact, Conrad’s border crossing was partly encouraged by the group of reporters on the side of West Germany. They paid attention to Constable Schumann Conrad for more than an hour as his behavior was a bit strange. Next, they shouted to him “Come over”, which gave him more courage. Right after landing in the territory of West Germany, he received the aid of the West Berlin police. Interestingly, the photographer, Peter Leibing, was standing near the wall at that moment. Immediately, he took a window of opportunity to capture the action of Conrad’s jumping over a barber barrier. This photo was featured in many magazines as a symbol of the cold war.\r\n\r\nNew life in West Berlin\r\nConrad Schumann stayed in the refugee camp in Marienfelde till the end of September. Then the West German government supported him in settling in a new house in Bavaria. He landed a job as a worker in the Audi plant. The picture of him leaping over a barbed barrier made him known not only in the city but also all over the world. However, it haunted him for the rest of his life, along with a lasting fear of the Stasi. He said in a press interview that he would never regret his escape from the Berlin Wall. But for some unknown reasons, he committed suicide by hanging from the limb of a tree in the middle of the summer of 1998. He passed away at 56 and was buried in the back of the house or the small garden in Kipfenberg in southern Germany.\r\n\r\nHarry Deterling\r\nMany Berliners made an attempt to flee East Germany via railroad, by individual escapes such as hiding in or on top of trains. But Harry Deterling, a train engine driver, made quite a different departure: a group escape. He found an opportunity to escape along a still-existing railroad line linking Albrechtshof station. Seeing the line had not been dismantled and the switches were still in operation, he discussed with his coal stroker, Hartmut Lichy, a plan to break out. Both of them asked their close friends and relatives if they wanted to join the trip.Deterling decided December 5 was the starting day when he turned 28. He went with his wife and four children along with Lichy’s girlfriend; however, she missed the train full of risk. A day before, Deterling persuaded his boss to operate an extra locomotive to develop his technical skills. People in the know were present before 7:30 on the rail platform. 18 members of Deterling and his colleague got train tickets whose route would end at Albrechshof. On that night, when Deterling ran locomotive 234 onto a disused track, 32 people were on board. Some hapless passengers didn’t realize what was happening. Finally, Deterling chuffed the last station in East Berlin in front of the complete surprise of the border guards. The following day, the train line was destroyed immediately.\r\n\r\nThanks to Deterling’s daring, well-organized plan, five entire families arrived in the West safely. For Deterling, the escape from the barbed barrier in East Berlin was a true birthday gift. At the refugee station, his wife celebrated his 28th birthday at the Marienfelde refugee camp with his companions. At the birthday party, Harry got a birthday kiss from his 24-year-old wife, Ingrid, who saw a bright future for her children in the path of education.', 7, '2021-08-17 18:37:56', 1);
