This time, instead of just knocking each other out of the sky and flooding the earth, the gods decided to meet and talk. When doing so, they decided that one among them should be sacrificed to become the new sun. One of the gods, a poor and humble one, sacrificed himself and became the sun.\r\n\r\nQuetzalcoatl \r\nQuetzalcoatl. credit@ Wikipedia\r\nHowever, the matter was far from over. The sun just hung in the sky without any movement. To make the sun move, all the gods had to sacrifice themselves. Once the sun did start moving across the sky, Quetzalcoatl took the responsibility of creating mankind. He did this by travelling to the underworld, from where he brought back the bones of the past generations to earth.\r\n\r\nWhile it was easy to enter the underworld, leaving was not so. Quetzalcoatl was chased by the god of the underworld while leaving. In his attempt to flee, he slipped and fell, thus breaking the bones of the past generations. What Quetzalcoatl did was to sprinkle some of the pieces with his blood and turn them into humans. And since the pieces varied in size, the men and women created were of different sizes too.\r\n\r\nThis is just one version of how humans were created. However, in all the versions, each creation brings the people closer to the ideal humankind.\r\n\r\nAztec calendar\r\nThe Aztecs organized their religious life around the calendar. As did most Mesoamerican people, the Aztecs too used two calendars simultaneously. The ritual calendar, consisting of 260 days, was called the tonalpohualli. The solar calendar, made of 365 days, was called the xiuhpohualli.\r\n\r\nIn both the calendars, each day had a name and number. The tonalpohualli was mainly used for divinatory purposes. There were 20-day signs and number coefficients of 1 to 13, which cycled in a fixed order.\r\n\r\nThe Aztec calendar stone\r\nThe Aztec calendar stone. credit@ Wikimedia commons\r\nThe xiuhpohualli had 18 months, each with 20 days. Before the new xiuhpohualli cycle, there would be a remainder of 5 ‘void’ days at the end of the previous cycle. Each month was named after a specific ritual festival at the beginning of the month. Many of these festivals were connected to the agricultural cycle. Every monthly ritual involved pretty much the entire population. Each household, calpolli temples and the main sacred precinct performed the rituals. Many of the festivals involved various forms of dancing and the re-enactment of mythical stories. The re-enactment was done by deity impersonators. Sacrifices were offered in the form of food, human and animal victims.\r\n\r\nEvery 52 years, the calendars reached a common starting point upon which a new calendar cycle started. This event was celebrated with the Xiuhmolpilli ritual or the New Fire Ceremony. The ritual comprised of old pottery being broken in all the households and all the fires in the Aztec realm being extinguished. A new fire was drilled over a sacrificial victim’s breast. Runners then brought the new fire to different communities after which it was redistributed to all the homes. On the night without fire, the Aztecs fear that the star demons, tzitzimime, might come down and devour the earth.\r\n\r\n', 3, 'thumb.jpg', '2021-07-27 00:00:00', 15),
(3, 'The Anthropological Significance of Internet Memes as Digital Artefacts', 'The Origin of the Word Meme\r\nThe word meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene. It was an attempt to explain how ideas replicate, mutate and evolve (memetics). Dawkins used the term to refer to any cultural entity that an observer might consider a replicator. Understood in those terms, memes carry information, are replicated, and are transmitted from one person to another. Additionally, they have the ability to evolve. They mutate at random and undergo natural selection, much in the same way that biological beings evolve. However, the concept of the meme remains largely theoretical.\r\n\r\nAn internet meme of Leonardo DiCaprio from the movie Django Unchained where he laughs sarcastically with a grey evening suit, gold coloured waistcoat and pink flower in his lapel This laughing meme of Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie from Django Unchained in 2005 has taken his popularity to new heights (Created with Meme Generator).\r\nMemes and the Theory of Natural Selection\r\nMemes are defined as culturally transmitted ideas and beliefs that can be spread from one organism, or group of organisms, to another. The concept that ideas are subject to the same forces of evolution as biological beings is not new. It was argued long before the digital era, during the time of Charles Darwin.\r\n\r\nA key component to the meme concept is that it can self-replicate. The replication and transmission of a meme occurs when one person copies a unit of cultural information involving a meme from another person. Therefore, it undergoes a type of natural selection, much like genes and viruses. Memes do this by means of variation, mutation, competition and inheritance. Each of these affects a meme’s reproductive success.\r\n\r\nAn internet meme of a woman with talk hair with her right hand in her hair, tears flowing down her face with the caption  While the “First World” terminology has been around for a while, the hashtag #firstworldproblems reached its peak in popularity on Twitter in 2011 (Credit: Stacker.com)\r\nMemetic transmission\r\nIn some ways, internet memes are like genes: passed from person to person. In a process of microevolution, memes spread through the behaviour that they cause in their hosts. These remixed, repeated messages from popular media are generated and regenerated until they start trending. Thus, internet memes that prove better at replicating and surviving are chosen in the meme pool. They are the ones that become the most popular within a culture.\r\n\r\nTherefore, memes that reproduce less may become extinct. However, others may survive, spread, and mutate. Internet memes that replicate the most enjoy more success. However, some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be harmful to the safety of their hosts. In addition, humans do not always copy memes perfectly. They may refine, combine or otherwise modify them with other memes to create new memes. Just like biological beings, they respond to outside influences. As a result, they can change over time.\r\n\r\nA diagram with 2 circles, one with genes and one with memes makinga connection. The background ais white, circles are black and the arrow is light green In some ways, internet memes are like genes, passed on from one person to another (Credit: Storality / Velikovsky)\r\nInternet Memes as Cultural Artefacts\r\nInternet memes rely heavily on social media. Consequently, memes are linked to the communication of younger generations as digital natives. Therefore, internet memes are considered a part of the evolution of our society. More specifically, they signify the development of youth culture and language. In a rebellious and youthful fashion, they are an ironic and parodic form of expression. Internet memes often contradict the common and accepted norms and rules of society.\r\n\r\nAs a result, internet memes can be seen as cultural barometers. This means that they embody expressions of our culture that can tell us a lot about where we are as a society. Not only do they reflect the way we think and talk about things, but they can also shape them. Therefore, internet memes can be defined as units of digital culture. It is safe to say that after nearly three decades, internet memes have rightfully earned their place as cultural artefacts of the digital world.\r\n\r\nThe internet meme Grumpy Cat of Tardar Sauce a white and brown cat who looks like a grumy person He is saying  “Tardar Sauce” the Grumpy Cat is arguably the most famous Internet meme cat of all time (2012) (Credit: Know Your Meme)\r\nThe symbolism of internet memes\r\nThe most interesting thing about internet memes is what they show us about ourselves. There are websites that attempt to track internet memes so that we can understand and chart how culture unfolds. Ironically, folklorists have been trying to do this for a very long time, but without the internet. However, scientists and historians who track internet memes have the opposite problem. Instead, internet meme trackers have too many cultural artefacts.\r\n\r\nAn internet meme screen grab from a tv interview that went viral on YouTube video of Kimberly  An image from a video of Kimberly “Sweet Brown” Wilkins being interviewed after having escaped a fire in her apartment building went viral (Credit: Memeful.com).\r\nTracking internet memes as cultural artefacts\r\nLike biological viruses, internet memes grow and spread and they come seemingly out of nowhere. Anything can become a meme. Even a video that is ten years old can suddenly be noticed by someone and be “recycled” into something famous overnight.  So, how do modern folklorists begin to track a meme?  In this case, because of their meteoric rise from obscure to trending, there is nothing they can ignore. All trends must be tracked.\r\n\r\nAnd it is only going to get worse as more and more people come online. They will not only view what there is already but add their own cultural trends. Of course, the secret weapon in tracking internet memes is technology. Unlike all other forms of media, the internet can be searched and indexed for specific terms and phrases. Naturally, this is a fact that meme “trackers” use well.\r\n\r\nAn internet meme of Chuck Norris ina cut off denim shirt a, a gun hoslter and 2 guns in his hands with a mean expression on his face with the caption  A typical Chuck Norris “tough guy” meme (2005) (Credit: Know Your Meme)\r\n', 2, 'thumbb.jpg', '2021-07-27 00:00:00', 60),
(4, 'Ableism and Modern Eugenics: A Result of CRISPR and Gene Editing', 'Historical Instances of Eugenics for Gene Editing\r\nThe literal translation of the term “eugenics” is “good creation.” Merriam-Webster regards “eugenics” as a practice of selective breeding for more favorable characteristics or to improve the population’s gene pool.  \r\n\r\nThe most notorious instance of eugenics probably has to do with Hitler’s dictatorship between 1933 and 1945. His enforcement of eugenics ultimately led to the genocide of around 11 million Jews during the Holocaust. The Nazis based their eugenics policies on aesthetics and racism. Because the Nazi Party believed in some superiority of the Aryan race, they wanted to eliminate those beneath the Aryans in their concept of racial hierarchy. In addition, the Nazis targeted institutionalized individuals with disabilities. It was these ideologies that the United States fought against during World War II. Yet, instances of eugenics took root in America. \r\n\r\nThis image shows the number of murders during the holocaust. The highest number of murders occurred between June and December of 1942. Yet, the actual holocaust kill rate was falsified by many publications. \r\nThe graph shows the number of murders per month over three years during the Holocaust. These murders of those considered racially inferior and disabled were a method of gene editing since they aimed to change the gene pool of the population. Image Source: advances.sciencemag.org\r\nMarriage Laws\r\nUnlike Nazi eugenics, American legislatures solely based eugenic policies off of ableism. Connecticut was the first state that adopted a law that promoted the practice. In 1896, Connecticut adopted legislation that barred the marriage of those with epilepsy, imbeciles, and feeble-minded. Unfortunately, similar legislation made its way to Kansas, New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. Not only did this law prevent individuals from getting married, but it also killed the American Dream. More contemporarily, preventing someone from an ailment from pursuing a social norm is baseless. Marriage laws aimed to prevent these individuals from reproducing children with the same disabilities and illnesses. Connecticut, among other states, later adopted sterilization laws. \r\n\r\nSterilization Laws\r\nSterilization laws were a step further in limiting the rights of Americans. In North Carolina, for example, the North Carolina Eugenics Board often met to determine the fate of patients. If the board concluded that a patient was feeble-minded, aggressive, promiscuous, or even unfit for parenting, they would force sterilization. Over 60,000 individuals were subject to sterilization in America based on eugenic ideologies. \r\n\r\nThis is a pamphlet that describes eugenics in America. The pamphlet mentions that \"mental defectives\" should not have children, and that selective sterilization \"protects\" children. \r\nThe pamphlet above was utilized by the North Carolina Eugenics Board. The pamphlet supports the fact that children do not deserve “subnormal parents” who may have a disorder either mentally or physically. This subliminally supports the practice of eugenics, without directly stating it. Image source: www.ncpedia.org\r\nSterilization laws typically target minority groups in America. Historically, minorities were not in the same socioeconomic classes as well-off white individuals and families. Therefore, this gives eugenic advocates a reason to oppose minorities reproducing. If a minority has children, the child lives in the same socioeconomic status as the parent. In a sense, eugenics aimed to limit the lower class population in America. Also, eugenics advocates wrongfully predicted no social mobility, giving board members and some doctors a reason to deny an individual’s sterility. \r\n\r\nStructural Barriers\r\nMinorities are also more unlikely to seek healthcare for various reasons. These reasons include structural barriers in the healthcare system, such as limited physicians. They may also live far from a hospital or have cultural values opposing primary care. As a result, they often have more visible health issues since they have gone untreated. Ideas of heredity swayed eugenics advocates. They believed illnesses prevail through generations without understanding genetic inheritance. Ableist idealists condemn ill or disabled children instead of working for improvements within the healthcare system. \r\n\r\n', 4, 'thumbbb.jpg', '2021-08-02 00:00:00', 12),
(5, 'Narrow Escapes from the Berlin Wall to Find Liberty', 'The Berlin Wall was a barbed barrier to the flow of refugees to find liberty after World War 2. The Communist Government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) was worried about the seemingly endless flow of refugees. Nearly 3 million young skilled workers, such as engineers, teachers, doctors, and nurses, had found a way to leave the GDR since the end of the blockage. Only in June 1961, around 19,000 people went to the west through Berlin. In July, 30,000 East Germans crossed the border, and in August 16,000 fled. The culmination point was that 2,400 defectors crossed the border in a single day.\r\n\r\nPrior to the construction of the wall, residents on both sides of Berlin moved around freely enough. They traversed the border to visit, to work, to shop, to enjoy pieces of plays or the movies. Trains and subway lines ran back and forth. But, every kind of transportation or communication was locked down after the building of the wall and barbed barrier, except three checkpoints: Helmstedt, Dreilinden, and the center of Berlin. Diplomats and officials of the allied nations could enter or leave if they met the strict requirements of the German East.\r\n\r\nThe Berlin Wall (1961 – 1989)\r\nBerlin Wall Between the East and West of Germany\r\nBerlin Wall Between the East and West of Germany – Credit: War History Online\r\nOn August 13, 1961, East Germany decided to construct barbed wire and concrete to cease mass defections from East to West. The Berlin Wall served as an ugly symbol of ideological division by snaking through the city. It was almost 27 miles long and built with a barbed barrier, under the control of attack dogs, and with a threat of 55,000 landmines. Though the barrier almost lasted between 1961 and 1989, it could not retain a massive democratic movement. The huge escape of defectors showed the not-too-distant fall of the social German Democratic Republic.', 2, 'thumbbb.jpg', '2021-08-17 00:00:00', 13),

Rambu Solo and the Makula: party for the dead\r\nRambu Solo is a farewell ceremony carried out by the Torajan people of South Sulawesi. For Torajan’s, death is not life’s grim finale. Instead, it is an integral part of an ongoing spiritual journey. In Toraja society, the ritual aims to honour the deceased and deliver their souls to the spiritual realm. In other words, it reconnects them to an eternity with their ancestors in a magical resting place known as ‘Puyo.’\r\n\r\nBefore Rambu Solo\r\nThe ceremony provides insight into how Torajan people define death. For them, dying does not necessarily mean goodbye because a person is not considered dead if Rambu Solo has not taken place. Before the ceremony, a resting corpse withered to the bone is not dead but rather sick or sleeping (or ‘makula’ in local tongue). Suppose Rambu Solo has not yet taken place. In this case, it is common for family members to continue care and grooming, often bringing their loved one’s bodies to lunch.\r\n\r\nDuring Rambu Solo\r\nThere are two processions during Rambu Solo. Firstly, the burial session (Rante), and secondly, the parade and art performances (Ma’Palao). The two events complement each other in sequence, and the ceremony must always follow these two phases.\r\n\r\nRante is conducted in front of a traditional ancestral house (Tongkonan). It involves wrapping the corpse (Ma’Tudan Mebalun) and decorating the coffin with gold and silver fabrics.\r\n\r\nThe second phase (Ma’Palao) entails the transportation of the body to the burial site. Once completed, family and friends gather to enjoy art performances. This final stage bursts with dance and colour; it is a concluding tribute to the deceased person. For Torajans, the scale of Rambu Solo is an indicator of social status; the bigger the party, the better.\r\n\r\nPeople gather to carry a giant decorated coffin as part of the Rambu Solo ritual\r\nImage Source: Sumber\r\n2. Tiwah: grave-digging for good luck\r\nIn Kalimantan, the Dayak tribe perform this strange ritual to exhume their loved one’s body from the soil and help tear the soul from its corpse.\r\n\r\nFor Dayak people, a transition of the soul from this world to the next is only possible after Tiwah is conducted. The ritual helps deliver the soul towards the afterlife by unearthing the body’s skeletal remains and transporting them to a sacred site known as Sandung; it is effectively a second funeral.\r\n\r\nThe strange practice is believed to deter bad luck and display the utmost respect and affection to the deceased’s ancestors. On the contrary, if Tiwah is conducted improperly, locals believe that the spirit of the dead will cement a curse on the family and fix eternal misfortune for its members.\r\n\r\nA group of people gather around the bones of a deceased love one on a blue piece of fabric during a Tiwah ritual \r\nImage Source: Viva\r\n3. Debus: ancient martial art\r\nDebus is a traditional martial art exclusively practised by Bantenese people in West Java. The art form involves a fusion of skills that require super-human inner strength, for example, skewering the body with metal spikes and walking on hot coal. Consequently, it is believed that those undertaking these acts are imbued with supernatural powers. The idea is that if you have complete faith in God, your life will not be harmed.\r\n\r\nA young man wearing a black outfit sticks his tongue out onto the edge of a sword during the Debus ritual\r\nImage Source: indoindians.com\r\nThe bizarre act displays competitive prowess. Against a background of music and dance, performers pierce sharp nails and knives through their tongues, cheeks and other body parts. Subsequently, the person’s body is believed to be immune to fire and sharp object attacks.\r\n\r\nA group of men wearing black burn themselves with fire on sticks during the Debus ritual\r\nImage Source: topindonesiaholidays.com\r\nWhere did Debus originate?\r\nThe term Debus is derived from the Arab word ‘dablus’ – a sharp iron weapon that has a round handle at its base. This is the object most commonly used in gruelling martial arts performances.\r\n\r\nIt is believed the extraordinary art developed in the 16th century during the reign of the first sultan of Banten. Debus was employed during this time as a method of animating the spirit of resistance against Dutch colonial powers.\r\n\r\n4. Nyobeng: skull bathing ritual\r\nThe word nyobeng originates from ‘nibakng’ – the thanksgiving ritual held after abundant harvests.\r\n\r\nNyobeng is an ancient Dayak headhunting ritual that is performed to express gratitude for peace and good harvests. It involves cleansing and bathing the sacrificed humans’ skulls from headhunting rituals called Mengayau. In West Kalimantan, dried human skulls are believed to possess intense supernatural powers. Freshly severed heads are praised for their potential to rescue a village from illness and disease.\r\n\r\nWhy the bathing ritual?\r\nIn Dayak culture, skulls are believed to summon rainfall. As a result, gathering cleaned-out skulls increases harvests and wards off evil spirits. As dried skull collections accumulate, their supernatural powers amass into a great spiritual force. Consequently, it is common for skulls to be collected and piled on top of one another in a huge bathing ritual.\r\n\r\nHeadhunting (Mengayau) has now been prohibited by the government. Still, the Nyobeng ritual continues as a way to express gratitude for good harvests.\r\n\r\nA man sits next to a pile of human skulls cloaked in a sheet during the Nyobeng ritual\r\nImage Source: indoindians.com\r\n5. Fahombo: stone jumping ritual\r\nFahombo is a coming-of-age ritual practised primarily in Nias on the western coast of Sumatra Island.\r\n\r\nThe stone jumping tradition is performed only by young people or men. Beginning at a young age, the person practices jumping over a rope. As they age each year, the rope height simultaneously increases until, eventually, they must jump over a two-metre-high rock without touching its surface.\r\n\r\nYou can watch a video of the jump in action here.\r\n\r\n', 2, 'thumb.jpg', '2021-08-16 00:00:00', 36),
(7, 'Food Linguistics: Evolution of Food, Menus, and Online Reviews', 'Food History: Ketchup\r\nJurafsky traces the origination of ketchup and wine and toasting, and even the order of meals to allow the reader to uncover the reasons behind global influences and culinary connection through language.\r\n\r\nDid you know that ketchup is actually Chinese and the word originally meant fish sauce?  Sweet-tomato ketchup actually originated from Asia as a fermented fish sauce and made its way to the United States and Europe. It comes from the Hokkien Chinese word, ke-tsiap, and is originally a sauce from fish that is fermented. In the 1690s, the British had a trading post in Bengkulu and they took the recipe back to the United Kingdom in order to try to replicate it. One of the earliest recipes, in 1732 is from the Indies.\r\n\r\nJurafsky believes that around this time, the word “ketchup” first came into the English language partially due to the fact that the English could not pronounce the Asian word, ke-tisap. Ketchup had become profitable and in several reports from traders from the East India Trading Company including Charles Lockyer, the dialogues in the reports revealed how important it was to be trading with Asia.  Lockyer said, “soy comes in tubs from Jappan, and the best Ketchup from Tonqueen (northern Vietnam) yet good of both sorts, are made and solvery cheap in China.. I know not a more profitable commodity.”\r\n\r\nA guide to toasting - Vino-Club\r\nSource: https://www.vino-club.co.uk/toasting/\r\nHistory: Drinking and Toasting around Food\r\nJurafsky explains how drinking cultures, including the act of toasting, became deeply embedded in cultures going as far back as 6000 BCE through libations and domestication of wine grapes. Domesticated wine grapes have been found to exist as early as 6000 BCE found in a Neolithic village called Hajji Firuz Tepe in the Zagros Mountains in Iran (71). While evidence appears to be unclear to how alcohol evolved, several types of wine and beer may have been associated with health and thought to have some antipathogenic properties. One early concept related to toasting is called a libation, an offering of mead, wine, or oil, that the Greek people poured to the gods before drinking. Overall, drinking and toasting have always played an important role in celebrations.\r\n\r\nWith these forgotten histories of ketchup, alcohol, and even ceviche (which is mentioned more in his book) that the author offers, the reader can value and recognize the hardships and labor that went into the procurement of food that appears as always available for society today. Throughout his historical and evolutionary analysis, he successfully finds how people were brought together and connected through food and how language evolved through the discussion and written reports on these different foods.\r\n\r\nFood White Menu Template with bright blue heading highlights\r\nSource – Easil Templates\r\nUnderstanding and Decoding Menus \r\nThe words in menus have linguistic, hidden clues about the origination of the food being prepared, the cost and the price of the restaurant, and also the types of chefs that run the restaurant. According to Jurafsky, expensive restaurants are very likely to display where each of their dishes originates by using words such as “grass-fed” and even over advertise their products. These types of places show pride in their work and accomplishments and even love to place prominence over their chef.\r\n\r\nCostly food establishments have an inclination to make use of more two-bit multisyllabic unique, fancy words such as “accompaniments, complements, traditionally, specifications, preparation, magnificent, tenderness,” while cheaper ones tend to use positive words shorter in length as “tasty,” “delicious,” “decaf,” and “sides” (13). Even the addition of one letter hints at a correlation with an increase of 18 cents (14).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, menus that contain long words may be more aimed at tourists or non-native eaters who do not eat the food being served every day and may be unaware of the actual food prices allowing the restaurants to secretively upcharge. If a restaurant emphasizes the types of “spices” or exoticness of a food, the price may be raised (14).  Jurafsky concludes that restaurant menus that consist of lengthy and descriptive words for each dish have a tendency for being expensive establishments overall.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a third idea presented by Jurafsky for understanding menu prices can be termed as  “linguistic fillers,” which are characterized as vague words like “delicious, tasty, mouth-watering, flavorful, scrumptious, tasty, wonderful and delightful,” and “appealing adjectives” such as “zesty, rich, golden brown, crunchy.” (15). Compared to expensive restaurants, cheaper restaurants use positive words, but also tend to use more vague words. Words such as “delicious and tasty” are used and are open for interpretation. Cheaper restaurants are likely to say that food should be served “your way” so it attracts more customers. The linguistic fillers and appealing adjectives are associated with cheaper restaurants because they serve as a tease for the guests; a promise for distinct or exceptional food that actually may not exist.\r\n\r\nThe author’s analysis of cost and word lengths depicts the true causation between expensive restaurants and lengthy words and cheap restaurants and shorter words.  The restaurants and chefs that want to be deemed as prestigious and appear to show pride in their work make use of different adjectives and verbs than the cheaper establishments that exist. The length and type of words can reveal so much about the culture of a restaurant including the types of people, social norms, and the type of establishment. However, Jurafsky’s analysis presented could be deemed as flawed in 2020, because he should have included several examples of data sets, graphs, statistics, actual numbers associated with restaurants.\r\n\r\nFood reviews \r\nSource: http://www.allstarsteamer.com/star-steamer-llc/yelp/\r\nPreview(opens in a new tab)\r\n\r\nDecoding Business Reviews  \r\nOnline reviews play a large role in helping people decide where to eat and purchase food, as well as reveal human psychological behavior, perception, and thought.  In a few studies, Jurafsky and colleagues make use of computational linguistics to examine the type of positive and negative Yelp reviews from restaurants in cities such as San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Boston, LA, Philadelphia, and Washington, which reveal people’s thoughts and feelings about restaurants from 2005 to 2011.\r\n\r\nWhile good or positive reviews include positive sentimental words such as “love, delicious, best, amazing, favorite, perfect, excellent, awesome,”  bad reviews use negative emotional words including “horrible, bad, worst, terrible, awful, disgusting, bland, gross, mediocre, tasteless, sucks, nasty, inedible, yuck and stale” (94).\r\n\r\nReviews also contain lots of expressive words and exaggerations. Jurafsky exhibits his term “semantic bleaching” as a way to describe human exaggeration or as an “awe,” responsible for changing meaning in words such as “sauce or salsa” from their original meaning of “salted.”\r\n\r\nIn positive reviews, people who have a good time at a restaurant are shown to be more likely to use sexual metaphors and also have a positive correlation with a higher price of the restaurant. It has been shown that the more reviews mention dessert, the more they have the tendency to like the restaurant (104). Good reviews are also associated with positive emotional words or positive words. Words such as “love, delicious, best, amazing, great, favorite, perfect, excellent, awesome, wonderful, fantastic, and incredible” are all examples of positive words used in food reviews (94).\r\n\r\nFor bad reviews, Jurafsky terms “negative differentiation” as a way to describe bad opinions rather than positive ones,  and these occur across many languages and many kinds of work.  Words like horrible and terror are used to mean “inducing horror” or “inducing terror” (94). In anthropology and psychology, most theorists have revealed that humans are biased and maybe more aware of negative situations. Negative reviews are shown to have the pronouns of “us” and “we” when describing distasteful traumas. Reviews that contain some experiences, such as waiting for food too long or not being served well, always start with the words “us and we” at different locations. In their analysis, they found that beers that were deemed as “bad” were written as “watery, bland, corny, skunky, metallic, stale, chemical, piss, yellow, disgusting, colorless, skanky, thin, flat, fizzy, and over-carbonated (96).\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, positive reviews of food establishments that served beer were deemed as “amazing, wonderful, fantastic, awesome, incredible, and great” regardless of the taste, feel, look or smell. It may be that negative reviews are actually more descriptive, and more time and care is taken into choosing words when leaving a bad review.\r\n\r\nResponse to Food Reviews by business owners\r\n\r\nMost interestingly, people actually respond more to positive reviews than negative ones (104). Oftentimes, restaurants try to deal with negative reviews by responding to the issue on the same review board, reconciling the issue, and/or providing a solution as soon as possible so the review doesn’t hurt their business. They want to make sure they emphasize with the customer and apologize for their actions so that the customer feels heard and also saves their business image.\r\n\r\nHumans have the tendency to remember positive reviews rather than negative views. However, if people have been traumatized by a certain event, they will remember the negative parts and may even post several reviews on different sites. Simply put, more research needs to be done to reveal why we simply remember the bad events more than the good ones, and why others remember the good events instead of the bad events? The linguistic analysis Jurafsky describes through the differences in positive and negative reviews serves as a framework for understanding linguistics, human nature, emotions, and opinions.\r\n\r\nSmell Training\' Could Help People Who Lost Their Sense of Smell From COVID-19\r\nSource: https://www.verywellhealth.com/smell-training-covid-19-5090018\r\nSmell Vocabularies in Menus\r\nSome languages have many, olfactory vocabularies including Cantonese and Mandarin, and these languages are rich in negative smells. Yik, the smell of rancid or oxidized oil or peanuts, Seng meaning fishy, blood smell, Jurafsky’s team analyzed several online reviewers and their discussion of beers they disliked at sou, meaning musky, muttony, gamy, body and order smell (97). While these negative vocabulary words are actually not being used as much in Cantonese, smell words still hold meaning. The vast majority of many different types of smell have made it difficult to maintain a “shared stable vocabulary of smell words” and people interpret each smell word uniquely (98).\r\n\r\nSound vocabularies with food \r\nSource: https://theconversation.com/excavating-hidden-and-forgotten-pasts-with-sound-140680\r\nSound Vocabularies in Food', 4, 'thumbbb.jpg', '2021-08-16 00:00:00', 245);
